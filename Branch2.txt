<title>Git flow for the Branches to commit</title>
<h1>Make Changes and Add Commits
After the new branch is created, it is time to get to work</h1>
<body>
<p1>Make changes by adding, editing and deleting files.

Whenever you reach a small milestone, add the changes to your branch by commit.

Adding commits keeps track of your work.

Each commit should have a message explaining what has changed and why after the changes I cannot make any commit I dont know why .

Each commit becomes a part of the history of the branch, and a point you can revert back to if you need to</p1>
<p2>When a Pull Request is made, it can be reviewed by whoever has the proper access to the branch.

This is where good discussions and review of the changes happen.

Pull Requests are designed to allow people to work together easily and produce better results together!

If you receive feedback and continue to improve your changes, you can push your changes with new commits, making further reviews possible</p2>
